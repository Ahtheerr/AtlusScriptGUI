# Usage
Place this EXE in the same folder as AtlusScriptCompiler.exe and run it. Arguments will automatically be passed to the compiler by dragging files onto the window.  
**Note:** P3P Library/Encoding does not work at this time. Use for Disassembly.  
Log now closes automatically when process is finished running. Choose "view log" to see details afterward.
