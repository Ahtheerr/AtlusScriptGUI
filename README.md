# AtlusScriptGUI
![](https://i.imgur.com/UNgxNBR.png)
GUI that automatically passes commandline arguments to AtlusScriptCompiler.  
Also useful for converting bitflag IDs from vanilla to Royal.
# Usage
Place this EXE in the same folder as [AtlusScriptCompiler.exe](https://github.com/tge-was-taken/Atlus-Script-Tools) and run it.  
Arguments will automatically be passed to the compiler by dragging files onto the window.  
**Note:** P3P Library/Encoding does not work at this time. Use for Disassembly.
